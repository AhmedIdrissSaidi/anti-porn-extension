Privacy Policy for Anti-Porn Extension

Last updated: February 2026

Anti-Porn is a Chromium-based browser extension designed to help users block explicit and adult content through domain blocking and optional content scanning. Your privacy is respected by design.

Data Collection

Anti-Porn does not collect, transmit, sell, or share any personal data.

The extension does not collect:
- Personally identifiable information
- Browsing history
- Authentication data
- Financial or payment information
- Location data
- Communications or messages

Local Processing

Anti-Porn may locally process website URLs and visible page text only on the user’s device for the purpose of detecting and blocking explicit content. This processing:
- Happens entirely on the device
- Is not logged
- Is not stored externally
- Is not transmitted to any server

Storage

The extension uses Chrome’s local and sync storage APIs to store:
- User settings
- Blocked or allowed site lists
- Custom keywords
- Commitment Mode and Panic Mode state
- Local statistics such as blocked attempts

All stored data remains under the user’s control and is never shared externally.

Third-Party Access

Anti-Porn does not use third-party analytics, advertising services, trackers, or remote code execution.

Data Security

Because no personal data is transmitted or stored externally, there is no exposure of user data beyond the local browser environment.
